# Tides in neutron star binary systems
Gravitational wave measurements from neutron star binary systems can be used to infer the equation of state of a neutron star. To facilitate this inference, one needs to model the tidal dynamics accurately. I have developed a formalism capable of incorporating dynamical effects on the tides due to the oscillation of stars. I am also interested in developing tidal models capable of incorporating the effects of shear and bulk viscous dissipation and measuring the properties of these transport coefficients using gravitational wave observations.

# Mathematical properties and consistency of effective field theories of gravity
Gravitational wave observations offer an exciting opportunity to test the validity of general relativity in highly dynamical and strongly gravitating regions of spacetime.
Several alternatives to general relativity have been proposed in the literature that present modifications to general relativity in strongly gravitating regions of spacetime by adding extra scalar, vector or tensorial degrees of freedom. 
To be viable, these theories have to be mathematically consistent in regions of strong curvature.
One such mathematical requirement is that these extensions have to be hyperbolic partial differential equations.
I have provided a precise criterion for testing when certain effective field theories of gravity breakdown in 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08477" target="_blank">spherical symmetry</a>
.

Black holes in general relativity are completely described by the value of their mass and spin. Certain alternatives to general relativity also add additional scalar charges to black holes. These scalar charges are absent in neutron stars. Therefore, during a dynamical gravitational collapse, these scalar charges must develop spontaneously. 
I have investigated the mechanism behind the development of the scalar charge in 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05178" target="_blank">spherical</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02039" target="_blank">axisymmetric</a> gravitational collapse. 

# Measuring the Hubble constant using neutron star binary systems
Gravitational wave measurements from binary neutron star mergers can be used to probe the large-scale structure of our universe.
This is possible due to the dependence of the tidal deformabilities of neutron stars on the intrinsic mass, which breaks the redshift-mass degeneracy in the gravitational wave signal.
To facilitate the measurement of the redshift using this technique, we need to understand the equation of state of a neutron star.
One way to bypass this requirement is to use a quasi-universal relationship between neutron star tidal deformabilities which are approximately insensitive to the equation of state.
I have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06589" target="_blank">worked</a> on understanding how such quasi-universal relations can be used to constrain the value of the Hubble constant using present and future gravitational wave observations.
