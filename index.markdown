# Welcome!

I'm a fourth year graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) working under the guidance of Nicolas Yunes. 
During my PhD, I have also had the pleasure of learning from and working with Justin Ripley, Jorge Noronha, Elias Most and Helvi Witek. 
Before joining UIUC, I was an undergrad at the Chennai Mathematical Institute where I worked with K. G. Arun and Alok Laddha.

My research interests currently include, modeling dynamical and dissipative tides in binary systems, understanding out-of-equilibrium relativistic fluid dynamics and gravitational wave data analysis.
